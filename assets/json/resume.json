      "summary": "In this work, we propose a biophysically-based model to illustrate changes in skin appearance under ultraviolet radiation exposure. We apply a mechanism of erythema and tanning to a multilayer volumetric skin appearance model to simulate observable erythema and tanning induced by sun exposure on the skin. The model demonstrates superior quality to the commonly used method with more convincing skin details and bridges biological insights with visual simulations."

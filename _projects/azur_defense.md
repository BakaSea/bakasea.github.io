[[Code]](https://github.com/BakaSea/AzurDefense)

* Used C++ to independently write the tower defense game, “AzurDefense”, which realized 2D overlooking game scenes with 3D.
* Adopted OpenGL as the graphics rendering framework and independently edited the rasterization process of the rendering pipeline.
* Independently developed a simple and convenient game engine including game logic, human-computer interaction, etc. by referring to Unity.

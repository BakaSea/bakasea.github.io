My name is Minghao Huang (黄铭昊). I am a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/). My research interest is computer graphics, mainly forcusing on rendering. Previously I received my undergraduate degree from the department of computer science and technology at Nanjing University, advised by Prof. Jie Guo, with people's scholarships for three years and the excellent graduate student honor.

Besides research, I am also interesting in games and animes. I mainly play shooting games like *Delta Force*, *Strinova* and *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege* and simulation games like *Cities Skyline* and *Minecraft*. I am a deep otaku, watching seasonal animes and mangas as well as playing anime games like *Azur Lane*. Here is my [Bangumi](https://bgm.tv/user/789994) (a Chinese anime website similar to MyAnimeList).

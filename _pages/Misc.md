Besides research, I am also interesting in video games and animes.

I mainly play shooting games. Before, I have played *Left 4 Dead 2*, *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege*, *Apex Legend*, etc. For now, I play *Delta Force* and *Strinova*. In addition, I also like playing simulation and sandbox games like *Cities Skyline*, *Satisfactory* and *Minecraft*. In fact, the reason why I started programming is that I wanted to develop mods for *Minecraft*. I used to be a leader of a Chinese Minecraft mods team, *Infinity Studio*, which was once famous among Chinese Minecraft community, for mods localization, mods and modpacks development.

I am a deep otaku, watching lots of seasonal animes and mangas as well as playing anime games like *Azur Lane*. Here is my [Bangumi](https://bgm.tv/user/789994) (a Chinese anime website similar to MyAnimeList). Some of my favorite animes are *Zombie Land Saga* and *Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club*. And I like collecting goods like acrylic stands, tin buttons and figures. I also sometimes create some MikuMikuDance (MMD) videos in [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/5367097). It's the love for animes drive me to computer graphics to create a fantastic anime game!

My name is Minghao Huang (黄铭昊). I am a M.S. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/). Previously I received my B.S. degree from the department of computer science and technology at Nanjing University, advised by Prof. Jie Guo, with people's scholarships for three years and the excellent graduate student honor. My research interest is computer graphics, mainly focusing on rendering, both physically based rendering and non photorealistic rendering. My goal is realizing fantastic video games (probably anime games)!

abstract = {Skin appearance modeling plays a crucial role in various fields such as healthcare, cosmetics and entertainment. However, the structure of the skin and its interaction with environmental factors like ultraviolet radiation are very complex and require further detailed modeling. In this paper, we propose a biophysically-based model to illustrate the changes in skin appearance under ultraviolet radiation exposure. It takes ultraviolet doses and specific biophysical parameters as inputs, leading to variations in melanin and blood concentrations, as well as the growth rate of skin cells. These changes bring alteration of light scattering, which is simulated by random walk method, and result in observable erythema and tanning. We showcase effects of various skin tones, comparisons across different body parts, and images illustrating the impact of occlusion. It demonstrates superior quality to the the commonly used method with more convincing skin details and bridges biological insights with visual simulations.},
